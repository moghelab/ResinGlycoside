# ResinGlycoside
 Some scripts related to the Resin Glycoside Project. These scripts have been written in Python 3 and can be run on a Unix system with a python installation. 
 
PLEASE NOTE: These scripts are provided as is. Some scripts have good documentation, others not so much. They were written for a specific project to work in a specific file structure. It is possible that your file structure may break the script. You are welcome to edit the code as you see fit to suit your own requirements. It is essential that you have a fairly decent knowledge of Python to be able to edit these scripts. 
 
When any script is run without any arguments, it will list the files required by it as inputs. You may freely edit the scripts as needed. 

1_parseMSDIAL: This folder has scripts to parse the GnpsTable and MGF files exported via MS-DIAL. Run the wrapper. It will run all scripts. 

2_rgAnnotation: This folder takes the final outputs of 1_parseMSDIAL scripts and produce a table of annotation of resin glycoside components. At the very minimum, steps 1,2,6 can provide the annotation.
