There are three types of files:

    mz132 -- Peaks with a pentose fragment
    mz146 -- Peaks with a deoxyhexose fragment
    mz162 -- Peaks with a hexose fragment

For how these files were obtained, refer to the above methods. Code used is uploaded here: https://github.com/moghelab/ResinGlycoside

Not all fragments are found in every species. MGF and parsed.fil files with no peak data correspond to species where no peak with the specified sugar combination was found.

Names of the files are in the following format:

01-Cent.xxx

The 01 (or any number 01-34) refers to the species ID as specified in the filelist.tab file

ABSTRACT

Acylsugars are a class of plant defense compounds produced across many unrelated families. Members of the horticulturally important morning glory (Convolvulaceae) family produce a diverse sub-class of acylsugars called resin glycosides (RGs), which comprise oligosaccharide cores, hydroxyacyl chain(s) and decorating aliphatic and aromatic acyl chains. While many RG structures are characterized, the extent of structural diversity of this class in different genera and species is not known. In this study, we asked whether there has been lineage-specific diversification of RG structures in different Convolvulaceae species that may suggest diversification of the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed from root and leaf extracts of 26 species sampled in a phylogeny-guided manner. LC-MS/MS revealed thousands of peaks with signature RG fragmentation patterns with some species producing over 300 signals, mirroring the diversity in Solanaceae-type acylsugars. A novel RG from Dichondra argentea was characterized using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy, supporting previous observations of RGs with open hydroxyacyl chain instead of closed macrolactone ring structures. Substantial lineage-specific differentiation in utilization of sugars, hydroxyacyl chains and decorating acyl chains was discovered, especially among Ipomoea and Convolvulus – the two largest genera in Convolvulaceae. Adopting a computational, rule-based strategy, we further developed a high-recall workflow that successfully explained ~72% of the MS/MS fragments, predicted the structural components of 12/13 previously characterized RGs, and partially annotated >1600 RGs. Overall, this study improves our understanding of phytochemical diversity and lays a foundation for characterizing the evolutionary mechanisms underlying RG diversification.

METHODS
Sample collection: Depending on the thickness of the seed coat, seeds were either sterilized using concentrated sulfuric acid or 10% trisodium phosphate (TSP) solution. Seeds with thick seed coats (e.g., Ipomoea tricolor) were acid scarified and sterilized with concentrated sulfuric acid for 15 minutes. Seeds with thinner seed coats (e.g., Dichondra argentea) were washed in 10% TSP for 10 minutes for surface sterilization. For both conditions, seeds were washed five times with sterile water afterwards. Student grade filter paper (VWR, Radnor, PA) was placed within a sterile petri dish and 1 mL of sterile water was added. The sterilized seeds were added to the petri dish and sealed with parafilm. Seeds were kept in the dark at room temperature for 4-10 days until germinated. When the radicle was clearly visible the seedlings were transferred to 4-inch pots and grown in a growth chamber under a constant light/dark (16 h/8 h) regime at 24 ºC for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, plants were moved to a greenhouse, re-potted if necessary and grown for approximately three months until samples were harvested.

Extraction: Leaves and roots of plants were harvested into 50 ml falcon tubes and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were rough ground and homogenized with a spatula. Approximately 100 mg of sample was weighed while keeping the material frozen and 300 uL of methanol containing 10 uM telmisartan per 100 mg of tissue was added to samples (except in species 28-32), and vortexed for 30 seconds. Two metal beads (3.2 mm and 2.3 mm) were added to the sample and samples were homogenized using a mixer mill (MM400, Retsch, Haan, Germany) at 30 bpm in 2-minute intervals for a total of 6 minutes within a 15-minute extraction period. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged for 30 seconds at 14,000 g to remove particulate. If supernatant still contained particulate, it was centrifuged again with the same parameters. Once all particulates were removed, the supernatant was transferred to HPLC vials for further analysis or stored at -80 °C.

Chromatography: LC-MS analysis was performed on a ThermoScientific Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC equipped with an autosampler coupled to a ThermoScientific Q-Exactive HF Orbitrap mass spectrometer using solvent A (water + formic acid (0.1% v/v)) and solvent B (acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Metabolites were detected using full MS1 coupled to a data-dependent MS2 method, extracting the top 10 most abundant ions (Full-MS/ddMS2) in negative ionization mode. The total scan range used was 200 to 2000 m/z. RAW files from the LC-MS runs were converted to abf files using AbfConverter (Reifycs, Tokyo, Japan) and used for further data analysis with MS-DIAL (Tsugawa et al., 2015). Converted raw files for leaf and root samples for each species were aligned to each other, and an alignment-based mgf file was exported.
